COVID-19 curbs got harsher. The climate crisis became worse. Episodes of violence against women more shocking. But a cute Olympics mascot, a handful of remarkable performances by female athletes, and the metaverse bubble served as welcome distractions. For me, personally, the year 2022 might look and feel a bit different.

This might be helpful if my goal was to become a generalist. However, as a language student specialized in zero, I seek to become a T-shaped talent who deep dives into a specific field first and also has basic knowledge in other fields. That’s basically the reason why I decided to change my job and started to work for the current startup as a technical writer. Of course, I encountered a handful of challenges and uncertainties in the new position. For example, when I first came to the company, I didn’t know what git was, how to manage content and collaborate with other colleagues using PRs, what documentation as code was, and let alone how HTML, CSS, JS work. Besides, the management of my current company has big differences from my previous one. This startup provides me with a platform to try something out of the box but also forces me to start from scratch.

For the new year, the softening of the COVID-19 control strategies indicates more opportunities to go overseas. So, I expect to travel overseas at least once this year! For personal development, in 2023, I’ll make plans to equip myself with more tech skills. Of course, learning new skills takes courage, and I’m willing to be a beginner, to experience the awkwardness of not knowing how things work. We are wired to seek comfort and avoid failure. It may seem counterintuitive, but I believe that the faster you fail, adjust and try again, the faster you succeed. Here, I’ll list my professional plans for 2023: Set up my personal GitHub Pages Write at lease one technical blog twice a week Write for InfoQ and CNCF Pass AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification by January Grasp frontend programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and get certified on freeCodeCamp by April Get more familiar with Docker and Kubernetes, and get certified by KCNA by the end of July Finish Foundations of Digital Marketing nad E-commerce on Coursera by September ","date":"2023-01-19","objectID":"/posts/2022-year-in-review/:2:0","series":null,"tags":["life"],"title":"2022 Year in Review","uri":"/posts/2022-year-in-review/#life-and-growth"},{"categories":[],"content":" Move forwardLayoffs have been the buzzword and hashtag of the year 2022. As tech giants Meta, Twitter, among many other big and small fish in the business ecosystem, undertake a firing spree, they are leaving several employees emotionally and mentally wounded. For some, the financial anxiety of losing a job is the real pinch. But for most, the emotional upheaval that a layoff brings, is the deeper wound that takes time to heal. Working for a tech company without IT background, I also suffered from insecurity and sometimes even undervalued myself. This sense became more intense when my company started to make redundancies and my peers doing similar things got laid off all of a sudden. However, it may be normal to feel helpless, hapless and hopeless, all at the same time. But we have got to find inner strength to rebuild our confidence after a layoff, and bounce back. I’m hopeful for 2023 despite many clouds and uncertainties on the horizon. I hope to meet and enjoy time with my friends and dearest ones in the coming year. Happy 2023!
